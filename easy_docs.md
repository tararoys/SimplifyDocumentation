Writing good directions with microsoft word is like having to take all of the water out of a swimming pool with a drinking glass. The process of writing good directions is hard.  When a thing is hard, you do not do it.

Writing directions is simple. A person who is able to use a keyboard is able to make good directions.

The things that are not simple are 
  1. Keeping backup copies of your work. 
  2. Making corrections to your work. 
  3. Putting your work online. 

I have a system that does all of the hard things with three commands. I do not spend hours making backup copies, making corrections, or puting my work online. I spend 10 seconds.  

This is how my process works:

1. I make a set of directions using my special template.  If I use this template, I am able to publish my blog in seconds. I will not have to make changes to the format. I do not have to take hours to make changes so that I can put my directions on the internet.  
2. I put my new set of directions in a the 'Articles' folder in my "blog" file. 
3. I go to the command line. I type
     
     git add .  && git commit -v 

This command is like a better version of saving a Microsoft word document. When you go to save a Microsoft Word document, it saves over your old set of directions.  If you make a mistake, you are not able to go back to the old version.  If you save with this command, however, it saves a new copy of your directions, and keeps all of the old versions.  it's like the computer keeps every draft of you directions in a stack of papers. The oldest version is on the bottom of the stack of papers. When you save a new version, you stick it on the top of the stack.  You are able to always go back to the old versions because they are still there, under the new version.  

4. Now, for the final part. 
    
    git push 

This command does two things for me. It saves a backup copy of my directions to a place called Github.  I have a system set up so that this command also sends a copy to my public blog.  My blog is smart and knows that if I send it a new set of directions that were made with my special template, I want those directions to be a new post on my website. So it posts those directions. Five seconds after I say 'git push,'' I have a new post on my website.
